            <li>Add the soaked chickpeas to a 3-liter stovetop pressure cooker. Also add 3 cups water and ¼ teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Pressure cook chickpeas for 10 to 12 whistles (15 to 20 minutes), or till they are tender and cooked well. Allow the pressure to release naturally, then check the consistency. It is important to cook the chickpeas till they are melt-in-the-mouth soft.</li>
            <li>Once cooked well, drain all the water and set the cooked chickpeas aside.</li>
        </ol>

        <ol>
            <li>Chop 1 medium-sized onion, 2 medium-sized tomatoes, 1 green chili, 4 to 5 medium-sized garlic cloves and 1 inch ginger.</li>
            <li>Add them to a blender jar</li>
            <li>Make a fine paste in a grinder or blender, then set aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Making chickpea gravy (Chole)</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure out all the ingredients for making the gravy before you start.</li>
            <li>Heat 2 to 3 tablespoons oil in a pan or kadai/wok. Add the following whole garam masala (spices): </li>
            <ul>
                <li>1 tbsp cumin seeds</li>
                <li>1 large Indian bay leaf</li>
                <li>2 inch cinnamon stick</li>
                <li>2 to 3 cloves</li>
                <li>2 green cardamom</li>
                <li>2 to 3 black peppercorns</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Fry the whole spices till they are fragrant but don't burn them.</li>
            <li>Next, add the ground masala paste and mix well.</li>
            <li>Keep stirring often. Sauté for 8 to 10 minutes (or more), till the oil starts to leave the sides of the masala paste. The paste will also thicken and become glossy.</li>
            <li>Serve chana curry with onions, wedges and bhature for the best taste.</li>
